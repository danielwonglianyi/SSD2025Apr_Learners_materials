## Practical 9: Ensuring API Quality with Unit Testing & API Documentation

**Introduction:**

This practical is designed to equip you with essential skills in backend development: ensuring API reliability through unit testing, enhancing API usability through comprehensive documentation. You will learn to use Jest for testing and Swagger for API documentation.

**Objectives:**

- Understand the importance and application of unit testing, API documentation, and request logging in backend development.

- Utilize Jest to write and implement unit tests for API controllers and models, including mocking dependencies.

- Generate comprehensive API documentation using Swagger and integrate it into an Express application.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completion of Practical 7 & 8 for the Polytechnic library API project.

**Deliverables:**

For this practical, you will be building upon your existing Polytechnic Library API project from Practical 7 & 8. The deliverables will involve integrating unit tests, API documentation, and request logging functionalities into that existing Polytechnic Library API project codebase.

### Part A: Unit Testing Your API

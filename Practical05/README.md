# Practical 05: Adding the View Layer to the Books API

## Objective:

This practical session focuses on adding a client-side View layer to the Books API developed in Practical 04. You will create simple HTML and JavaScript files that run in the browser and interact with your API endpoints to perform CRUD operations, demonstrating the separation between the backend API and the frontend presentation layer.

## Target Audience:

Students who have successfully completed Practical 04 ("Building a Robust CRUD API with MVC, Validation, Error Handling and Preventing SQL Injections").

## Prerequisites:

- Successful completion of Practical 04, including the `books-api-mvc-db` project with MVC structure, validation, error handling, and parameterized queries implemented.

- A working Node.js/Express development environment.

- Microsoft SQL Server Express installed and configured.

- The `ssd_db` database and `Books` table populated.

- Familiarity with basic HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript (`fetch` API).

## Overview:

This practical is divided into two parts:

- **Part A: Lab Activity** - Hands-on implementation to set up the static file server and build the basic HTML/JavaScript frontend for Read (All), Create, and partial Update/Delete functionalities.
- **Part B: Homework** - Applying the learned concepts to the Students API and reflecting on the project's evolution and key learning points.

Refer to the `PartA_Lab.md` and `PartB_Homework.md` files for detailed instructions and tasks.

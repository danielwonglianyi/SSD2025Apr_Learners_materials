# Practical 03: Building REST API with MSSQL Integration

## Objective

This practical session focuses on building a Books API connected to a Microsoft SQL Server Express database via the `mssql` Node.js package. This will enable our API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book data using a persistent data store.

We will use Express's built-in middleware for parsing request bodies. The API will perform basic Read and Create operations by embedding the mssql logic directly into the routes, adding the GET and POST routes in separate steps. Finally, you will be asked to reflect on the different ways we organized the code within app.js during this practical.

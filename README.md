### ‚ö†Ô∏è Academic Integrity Reminder

Please be reminded of the following:

- **Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.** All work submitted must be your own.
- **Use of generative AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) is only allowed **if explicitly permitted by your tutor**.
- If AI tools are used, **you must clearly document** how and where they were used (e.g., code generation, explanation, etc.).
- Submitting AI-generated content as your own original work **without proper acknowledgement** may be considered academic dishonesty.

‚û°Ô∏è **Always check with your tutor** if you're unsure about the rules regarding AI usage for practicals or assignments.
